Two years ago, the U.S Air Force opened its doors to hackers with the launch of the Hack the Air Force challenge. Since then, the Air Force has run numerous other bug bounty challenges, ranging from logistics sites to custom hardware and engaging thousands of hackers along the way. Hear from Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Dr. Will Roper and Defense Digital Service hacker Jack Cable on the Air Forceâ€™s engagement of hackers via bug bounties and future initiatives in aviation security. In this open discussion, we encourage attendees to share their thoughts on how the Air Force can continue to work with the security community to improve the state of aviation security.
