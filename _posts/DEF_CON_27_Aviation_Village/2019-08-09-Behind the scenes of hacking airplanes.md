We show how we hack planes for real without getting in any trouble
The session aims to provide insights on real-life experiences gathered from the security engineering tasks and assessments of modern aircraft systems.

Particular focus is placed on explaining how the interaction between safety and security is assessed and how responsible teams can interact and combine their diverse set of skills. Examples and technical overviews of the classes of systems, interfaces and audit methodologies are given to precisely demonstrate how work in this area is laid out and executed, and to emphasize their importance in the transportation industry.

Additionally, the talk will highlight the combined industry effort that currently goes into dealing with the changing security threats in modern aircraft from a technical audit and security engineering perspective.
