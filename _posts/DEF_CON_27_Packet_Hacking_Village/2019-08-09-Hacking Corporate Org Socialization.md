There is growing community of hackers who refer to themselves as "Chameleon Hackers" and practice an organizational socialization technique they call "code switching." Code switching is a "tradecraft" practice used by chameleon hackers to consciously change their mannerisms, outward appearance, dress, thinking, physical characteristics, and their language in order to achieve socialization in either a virtual or live setting. The briefer will draw on his December 2018 doctoral dissertation to describe a framework for how these chameleons hackers go about their code switching tradecraft and then discuss examples of how they "hacked" the hacker community and the Corporate C-suite
