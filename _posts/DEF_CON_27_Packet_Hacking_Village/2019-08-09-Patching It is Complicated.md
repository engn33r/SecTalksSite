Patching â€“ it's complicated. Organizations at every level struggle with security updates in a fundamental process that seems more like a necessary evil than a best practice. The fact is, one size does not fit all when security patches get issued and things can go very wrong. What actually determines enterprise patching cycles? How should we prepare for the pernicious spread of unpatched BYOD that gets connected? We need to go beyond just finding the sweet spot between mitigating business risk with vulnerability exposure. Because the cure isn't supposed to be worse than the disease.
