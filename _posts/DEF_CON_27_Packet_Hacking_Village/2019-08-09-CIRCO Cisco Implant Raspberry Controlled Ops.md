Designed under Raspberry Pi and aimed for Red Team Ops, we take advantage of "Sec/Net/Dev/Ops" enterprise tools to capture network credentials in a stealth mode. Using a low profile hardware & electronics camouflaged as simple network outlet box to be sitting under/over a desk. CIRCO include different techniques for network data exfiltration to avoid detection. This tool gather information and use a combination of honeypots to trick Automation Systems to give us their network credentials!
