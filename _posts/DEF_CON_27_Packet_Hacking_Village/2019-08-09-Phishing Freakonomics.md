This presentation is the story of the success and failures of building a security awareness program at a Top 20 CPA firm, and finding "the hidden side" of why users fail phishing exercises (both simulated and not!). The presentation will cover how Elasticsearch was used to correlate awareness training, phishing test, and HR data together, examine real results from this work, and the improvements that were made to improve user awareness and reduce phishing related security incidents.
