As adversaries look for new methods of creating malware, steganography has seen a resurgence. In this session, we'll review this black art and uncover recent steganographic malware weaponizing techniques. We'll cover techniques that include file and image embedding techniques invisible to malware and intrusion detection systems, methods of exploiting weak networking protocols for covert communications, mischievous IoT devices, and cloud data hiding methods. But we don't stop there, our organic research has uncovered numerous other ways in which malware could be embedded in an effort to prepare threat researchers with the knowledge to improve their tools and fortify their networks.
