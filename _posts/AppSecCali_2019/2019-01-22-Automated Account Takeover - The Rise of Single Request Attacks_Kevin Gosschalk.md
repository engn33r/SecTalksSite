Description: Account takeover is growing. Attackers swoop in after credential spills and use software to automatically match breached email addresses with the top 10 most common passwords. While this approach, known as a single request attack. may appear unsophisticated, attackers commonly use headless browsers, execute JavaScript like a legitimate human user, and present dynamic client and network fingerprints. This session reviews real-world case studies where ATOs have been scaled via single request attacks.

These case studies unpack the compounding effect caused when businesses use depreciated mitigation strategies and profiles the growing incentive attackers have across other use-cases and verticals. The session scrutinizes past approaches to curbing ATO and explains why single request attacks have increased and examines tested pathways toward mitigating and preventing single request attacks.
