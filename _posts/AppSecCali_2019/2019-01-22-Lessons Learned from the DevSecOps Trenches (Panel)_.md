Description: The adoption of agile development practices and DevOps has enabled companies to iterate more quickly, allowing them to be more responsive to customer needs and deliver features in a fraction of the time. While this rapid release cycle has a number of benefits for the engineering team, it can tax already time- and person-limited security teams, who are usually outnumbered by engineers 100:1 or more.

To keep up with growing engineering teams and the rapid pace of development, security teams have begun investing heavily in tools, processes, and policies that more efficiently and effectively amplify their efforts.

Join us for a candid panel discussion of how several companies have worked to scale their AppSec program, including senior security team members from Dropbox, Netflix, Datadog, DocuSign, and Signal Sciences.

We’ll discuss a number of relevant topics, including:
* What are some initial, high ROI minimal security engineering efforts that are valuable to pursue first?
* Which security tools, processes, or libraries have been the biggest wins at your company?
* What are three things you’d do in any organization you join?
* What are three spectacular failures you’ve had?

Attendees will leave with specific, practical and actionable lessons they can apply immediately to their organizations. We’ll leave extra time for questions at the end to ensure we answer the audience’s most pressing needs.
