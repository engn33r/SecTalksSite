Description: In this presentation, Koen will share his experiences with Product Teams at Riot Games and how those teams do or do not take security into consideration. Every product team is unique; but they all behave in similar security patterns, and care about security in predictable ways. Using metrics of our Bug Bounty program and security review process, we’ll dissect the impact that team culture and process have on the security posture of a product. The framework that we’ve created allows you to quickly see what makes a good team good, and how other teams can improve. Taking into account how agile organisations want to operate, we will look at some tools you can introduce into your product teams to help raise the security bar.
