Description: Intoducing security testing tools to a QA or developers workflow can be difficult when the tools aren't easy or intuitive to use. Even for security professionals, the friction of cumbersome security tooling can prevent them from getting the most from a tool or being effective with their time.

This talks focuses on how the a new development for the OWASP ZAP project, the Heads Up Display, and how it can enable developers and security professionals alike to get the most out of the attack proxy. By coupling ZAP closer to the browser and presenting a new UI we can enable new ways to interact with and extend ZAP that will make using it more intuitive to use. The talk will cover the motivation behind the project, the browser technologies that power it, and how you can start using it.
