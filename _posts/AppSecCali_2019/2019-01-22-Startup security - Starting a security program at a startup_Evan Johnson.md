Description: There's no blueprint for how to be successful at a small startup. Startups are quirky, ambiguous, and full of challenges and broken processes. Startups also have a high risk tolerance and rarely introduce security from the beginning. This talk will discuss different approaches to introducing security at a company, how to be successful as a security professional at a startup, and how to integrate your security team with the rest of the company.
