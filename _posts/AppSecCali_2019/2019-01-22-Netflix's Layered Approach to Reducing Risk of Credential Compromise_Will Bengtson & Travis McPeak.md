Description: Building a secure system is like constructing a good pizza â€“ each individual layer adds flavor that ultimately builds to the perfect bite. At Netflix we have hand-crafted ingredients that by themself are scrumptious, but when placed together strategically on the crust (read: cloud), constructs a pizza so large that any pizza lover (read: attacker) would be challenged to finish.  Attendees will learn the secret to the sauce that is Netflix Infrastructure Security, be equipped to start baking pizza in their own kitchen, and leave satisfied.
