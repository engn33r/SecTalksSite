Internet of Things (IoT) devices have always been vulnerable to a variety of security issues. In 2013, Independent Security Evaluators (ISE) performed research on IoT devices that showed how rich feature sets could be leveraged to compromise devices. Today, we show that security controls put in place by device manufacturers are insufficient against attacks carried out by remote adversaries. This talk summarizes some of the best stories from our research project aimed to uncover and leverage new techniques to circumvent these new security controls in embedded devices.
