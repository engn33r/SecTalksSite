Electrical Vehicle Charging Points are relatively new on the field and security level of these devices are quite low at the moment. Unfortunately we see lots of EV charging points connected to the internet. This immaturity brings lots of issues and allows various attack paths from charging their cars for free to executing remote code and abusing these systems to have a huge botnet such as next Mirai. As an example, the vulnerabilities found on a specific Electrical Vehicle Charging Point will be presented during this talk. This talk will cover the findings that disclosed already[1] and fixed, and also cover a quite straightforward denial of service and remote code execution vulnerability that does not acknowledged and fixed by the vendor.
