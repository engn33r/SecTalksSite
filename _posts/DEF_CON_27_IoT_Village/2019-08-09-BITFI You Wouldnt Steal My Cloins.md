Never, ever claim your smart product is unhackable. Don't snort bath salts either. The Bitfi is/was a hardware brain-wallet for crypto currency. John McAfee was probably paid to promote it & wisely identified that it was unhackable. @cybergibbons gathered a crack team of hardware and software researchers from across the world, including several of the team at PTP. Over a 2 week period they utterly ruined the Bitfi. A lot of this story is untold, particularly around the real-time disclosure and back-end coordination. We'll also look at what they could have done to improve their security & a quick look at the Bitfi 2.0 if it gets to market in time! Since then, we've encountered and ruined many more products that made unhackable claims. We'll demo those too."
