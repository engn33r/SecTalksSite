This presentation shows how to use Splunk to provide the analyst with a comprehensive vision of AWS/GCP/Azure security posture. Presenters will outline how to ingest the audit data provided by open source tool Cloud Security Suite into Splunk to analyze cloud vulnerability, harden multi-cloud deployments and visualize multi-cloud threat surface. Presenters will also demonstrate use cases based on Splunk knowledge objects (Tables, Dashboards, Alerts, Field extractions, Lookups, etc), in order to take advantage of the information provided by various supporting tools like Scout2 and G-Scout projects for cloud API auditing.
