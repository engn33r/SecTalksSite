In this talk I will share my experience about how I hacked different automotive clouds, techniques I used and goals I pursue after connecting.

In this talk I will give real life examples of:

From zero to hero â€“ Full backend control with examples
Common fails which allow me to jump between networks
Dangers of connected cars - Taking over a car from the cloud
How to break a production line
Cloud credentials leakage
I will talk about the main connectivity areas I look for, supplier integrations and differences between normal clouds and automotive clouds. Once I got a good foothold, Possible targets and places which can harm the most. Where can I jump next inside and how deep the rabbit hole goes.

This will be a technical talk going into places I've experienced personally in the last few years and will try to give a glimpse of the fun life of hacking into the vehicle ecosystem
