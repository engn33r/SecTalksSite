eduroam networks are designed to provide wireless access to researchers and lecturers around the world. However, it is known that there are now 10,000 eduroam hotspots in 100 countries around the world. eduroam users can access these networks with information such as student numbers, email address, ID number, and special user names. I have done research on these networks and as a result of this research, I have found that eduroam networks are misconfigured in many parts of the world and that eduroam users are forced to mislead. Through this incorrect configuration, we have determined that the user's password information as a clear-text. This way user information can be collected, with the password information obtained, can be accessed to student information systems, e-mail, and computers. As a result of all these researches, we have developed a portable project with the raspberry pi and our own developed tools, so you can collect everything. In this talk, we want to talk about the results of this research with a live demo and share our new project."
