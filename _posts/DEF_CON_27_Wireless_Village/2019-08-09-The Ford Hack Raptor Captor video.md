This talk will show flaws with development of security protocols in New Ford key fobs. This will exploit several areas. The ability for a denial of service to the keyfob WITHOUT jamming. How to trick the vehicle into resetting its rolling code count. How to lock, unlock, start, stop, and open the trunk of ford vehicles using a replay attacked after resetting rolling code count. How to find the master access code for Fords keypad to bypass security. This talk will also demonstrate how to reset your key fobs if they are attacked by a deauth attack. We will also demonstrate gnu-radio script to automate RF collection of Ford key fobs. As seen on HAK5 episodes 2523-2525
