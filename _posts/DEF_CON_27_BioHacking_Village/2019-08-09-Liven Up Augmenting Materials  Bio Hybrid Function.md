What tools are currently available to us to create “living” or bio-hybrid materials—those that can be animated with biological functionalities for growth, response, distributed information processing, and cuing to the physical and chemical environment (a.k.a. the IOT before the digital IOT)? We seek fascinating ways augment the existing devices (i.e. pregnancy tests), 3D printed objects, and fabrics to interface with engineered living systems. The illustrated applications of these bio-hybrids range from disease-detection, programmable patterning of chemicals or pharmaceutics, and embedded reactivity to environmental DNA or particles.
