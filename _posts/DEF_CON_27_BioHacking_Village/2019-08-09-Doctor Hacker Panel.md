Evaluating the clinical impact of a vulnerability has significant implication on how the vulnerabilities is handled both pre and post disclosure including how it is communicated to physicians and patients. Open and transparent communication between the clinical and security researcher communities is essential to ensure that researchers understand the impact that medical device vulnerabilities will have on patient health and safety and clinicians have a better understanding of security implications to be able to recommend an appropriate response for their patients. This panel which includes medical security researchers and practicing physicians and healthcare technologists will discuss the challenges of evaluating the clinical impact of medical device technologies and the opportunities for researchers and healthcare processionals to work more closely together.
