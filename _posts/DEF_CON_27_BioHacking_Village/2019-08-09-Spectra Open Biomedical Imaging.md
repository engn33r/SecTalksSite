Biomedical Imaging has previously been expensive and near impossible to hack and experiment with. If more people experimented and understood how imaging works we could move it forward much faster and make these transformative technologies available to everyone. In this talk I'll present Spectra: a tiny 2" device that uses safe levels of AC current to recreate an image of any conductive material such as your lungs, arm or head, using the same tomographic reconstruction technique as a cat scan.
