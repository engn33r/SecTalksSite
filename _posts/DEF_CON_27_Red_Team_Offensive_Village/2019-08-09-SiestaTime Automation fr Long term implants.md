Red Team operations require substantial efforts to both create implants and a resilient C2 infrastructure. SiestaTime aims to merge these ideas into a tool with an easy-to-use GUI, which facilitates implant and infrastructure automation. SiestaTime allows operators to provide registrar, SaaS and VPS credentials in order to deploy a resilient and ready to use Red Team infrastructure in less than five minutes. The generated implants will blend-in as legitimate traffic by communicating to the infrastructure using SaaS channels (e.g. GMail, Twitter). Use your VPS/Domains battery to deploy staging servers and inject your favorite shellcode for interactive sessions, clone sites and hide your implants ready to be downloaded, deploy more redirectors if they get bustedâ€š SiestaTime is built entirely in Golang, with the ability to generate Implants for multiple platforms, interact with different OS resources, and perform efficient C2 communications. Terraform will help to deploy/destroy different Infrastructure.
