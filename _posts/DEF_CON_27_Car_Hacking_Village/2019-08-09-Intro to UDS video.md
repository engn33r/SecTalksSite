What is UDS and how can it help me hack cars?"

The goal of this talk is to give a brief introduction to UDS (ISO 14229), what the capabilities of UDS are, why automotive ECUs implement it, and how it is useful in hacking cars. The talk will have examples using standard Linux socketcan interfaces as well as CanCat scripts to help people discover UDS devices and services on their own vehicles
