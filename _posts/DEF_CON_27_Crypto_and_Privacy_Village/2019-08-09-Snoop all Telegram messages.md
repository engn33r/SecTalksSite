Privacy is important for all kinds of people no matter what business or social status they are in. One of the cornerstones of privacy in our days is the secure messaging applications like Telegram, which deploy end-to-end encryption to protect the communications. At the same time these kind of applications have become so important that bug buying companies are now paying up to $500,000 for exploits on these platforms or just $15,000 for information disclosure exploits. It is no news that Telegram has been targeted by several intelligence agencies to allow the interception of messages. Several clone applications have been created and distributed with the intent of spying on their users. Telegram however, can be abused allowing the message interception on non-rooted Android device and without replacing the official application.
