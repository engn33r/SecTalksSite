Zero knowledge proofs are powerful tools; come learn about how they work and what they enable! We'll get down and dirty in the details of Bulletproofs, a zero knowledge proof protocol that doesn't require trusted setup. I'll walk you through the math/crypto of Bulletproofs, alongside my open-source implementation in Rust. You'll walk away with an appreciation for zero knowledge proofs, a deeper understanding of Bulletproofs, and hopefully some interest in tinkering on or building systems with zero knowledge proof protocols yourself!

BIO
Cathie was an applied cryptographer at Chain and Interstellar. She enjoys working on open-source zero knowledge proof implementations and protocols for confidentiality in blockchain systems. She has a background in distributed systems and cryptography from MIT. When she isn't designing better blockchain protocols, she can be found climbing tall rocks and performing aerial silks.
