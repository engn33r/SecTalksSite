The BADASS army is an organization that started with one woman in Ohio, and within two years has helped thousands of people get their private images removed from unauthorized websites, helped pass laws criminalizing “revenge porn”, and teach victims the necessary tech skills to protect their private pictures and videos. Katelyn Bowden has brought this fight to a global level, and is here to talk about battling revenge porn the BADASS way. We will be discussing privacy laws, sensitive media storage, and safe sexting, along with the methodology of image abuse perpetrators.
