As the cryptocurrency industry grows in prominence, bankers, consultants, and information security specialists have moved into the space that was once the territory of hackers, cypherpunks, and anarchists. This is a talk on the corporatization of Bitcoin, the obsessive horse race reporting on its price, and the battle lines that are today being drawn between where this technology will go and who will get it there.

This speaker will identify unmet needs in Bitcoin that bankers, consultants, and InfoSec can’t figure out. There is much work to be done and the people who can get us there are being chased from that field. If you’re creative and capable, come with your notebooks. This speaker will offer an insider’s view on a laundry list of problems that need solving.

DEF CON organizers this year issued a reminder: “DEF CON is a hacker con, not an InfoSec conference. Hackers are more focused on the joy of discovery, irreverence, novel if impractical approaches. InfoSec is more focused on enterprise, frameworks, and protecting the interests of share holders. There is great value in both types of content, but our con is a hacker con by design.” This promises to be a talk geared toward hackers.
