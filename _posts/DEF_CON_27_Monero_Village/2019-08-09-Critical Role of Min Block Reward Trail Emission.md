Francisco will provide an overview and review of blockchain scaling and fees in Monero. He will review the relationship between fees and the Cryptonote (now Monero) penalty with an emphasis on the impact of the block reward on fees. He will focus on rational miner behavior, and how this creates a fee market in Monero which is totally dependent upon the block reward. He will also consider the case of the block reward going to zero, how this limits the Satoshi fee market in Bitcoin and the critical differences between Monero and Bitcoin. In addition, he will consider the possible impacts of block rewards falling to zero on large block and adaptive block crypto-currencies.
