A Texas bill has been introduced that encourages the use of what is termed a “verified identity digital currency,” which is a currency that allows the true identities of the sender and the receiver to be known. In addition, the bill mandates the verification of senders’ identity when receiving funds from a non-verified currency. This talk will consider the meaning of “digital currency” with reference to Federal and State agency interpretations and relevant case law and then evaluate the potential impact of the bill on small businesses and the public at large.
