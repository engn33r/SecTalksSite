Diego will explain why Moneroâ€™s user experience needs improvement for wide adoption. He will introduce theories of good UI/UX, and he will explain how other open-source projects handle these challenges with limited resources. He will give recommendations to developers to create more accessible and friendly projects on the first pass with little additional effort, and how existing, large projects can further incorporate advanced techniques into their development plans.
