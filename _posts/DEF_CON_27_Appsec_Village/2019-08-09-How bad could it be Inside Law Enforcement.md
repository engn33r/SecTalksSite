There are over 17,000 police agencies and 38,000 local governments in the US. They all use software to track your taxes, handle 911 calls, and and store reports documenting the worst days of citizens' lives. AppSec is damn important, but most agencies are lucky to have an IT department, let alone anyone looking after security.

The apps in LE and Local.gov are generally hidden from scrutiny. When the end-users don't have the resources to dig into what happens under the hood, what sort of flaws sneak into those products? This talk will take you behind the curtain and show you the gnarly stuff your tax dollars paid for, vulns found and fixed, and how you can help make things better.
