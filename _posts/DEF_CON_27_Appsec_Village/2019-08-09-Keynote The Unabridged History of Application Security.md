Application Security began in the early 60's where plain text password storage, no password policy, poor access control and other massive security problems were the norm. This talk with review the history of application security to help illustrate not just how much application security has gotten better, but also how the rate of positive change has been getting better as well. This fun ride through the history of application security is meant to inspire those who work in the industry. We are often looking closely at failure and insecurity, but when we step back and look at our industry historically, we can all see just how much things truly are getting better.
