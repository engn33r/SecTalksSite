BloodHound was originally built for Pentesters to easily identify highly complex attack paths but it can also be used to improve the overall security posture of your Active Directory. We will start with a short introduction to graph databases and how the different parts of Bloodhound work.  We will then discuss some useful tips on using the GUI to visualize various attack paths then we will venturing into the world of custom Cypher Queries. Using this new knowledge, we will set off on a path of destruction, targeting the attack paths in our environment and visualizing the effects of our planned remediations on these attack paths.
