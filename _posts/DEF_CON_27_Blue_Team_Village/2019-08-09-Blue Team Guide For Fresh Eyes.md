The life of a blue-teamer is daunting. There are logs to sift through, tasks to automate, incidents to triage, vulnerabilities to manage, meetings to attend, coffee to drink, etc. Scenarios have moving parts, procedures might not be documented, and solutions can vary. At times, the responsibilities can be compared to an ever growing fire, and all there is a pail of water. How do you put out the flames if you're not a seasoned professional? This talk lays out existing challenges for those trying to break into the fast-moving world of defensive security and ways to tackle them. Included are anecdotes, highlights, and pro-tips.
