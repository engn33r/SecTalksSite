Following testimony in Congress and a lengthy investigation of the Equifax breach in 2016, U.S. House of Representatives drafted a report. The report is AMAZING! It includes details of Equifax corporate structure, IT infrastructure, and covers timelines and minutiae of the breach itself. It has information that is extremely interesting and useful for security practitioners, but we might not all have the time or interest to wade through 97 pages of deep information. I did that for you! My talk is a comprehensive review of the report that covers everything I considered interesting or important.
